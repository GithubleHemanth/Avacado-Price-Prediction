In this avocado price prediction project using machine learning, we aim to develop a model that can forecast the prices of avocados based on historical data and relevant features. Employing techniques like data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training, we utilize machine learning algorithms or time-series forecasting methods to predict future avocado prices. The project involves integrating the predictive model into a user-friendly interface, allowing users to obtain accurate and timely avocado price forecasts. The goal is to provide valuable insights for stakeholders in the avocado industry, helping them make informed decisions related to pricing, supply chain management, and market trends.
